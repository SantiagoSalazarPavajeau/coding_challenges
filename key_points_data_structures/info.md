## Basic types:

Manipulate individual bits in an integer.
Iterate over bits of integer (bitmasks, shifting).

## Arrays

Dont read past last element.
Manipulate / compare elements.

## Strings

Joining, splitting, searching substrings, replacing, parsing. (cant be done on arrays)

## Lists

Sequence of nodes.
Inserting and deleting is 0(1).
Obtaining an element is O(n) so is expensive.
Zipping a list so nodes are reused and memory is not allocated.
Pointer swap ping.

## Binary Trees

Hierarchical relationships.
Searches.
Locking-unlocking nodes. O(n) or O(h) h being height of tree.


## Heap

Binary trees with priority. (deletion deletes highest priority)

## Hash Tables

A key and value tuns on O(1).
Resizing can be O(n).

## Binary Search Trees

Store objects that are comparable.
Solves every data structures problem efficiently.
Insertion and deletion is O(log n)
